5. MEMORY.md: The "Long-term Brain"
Purpose: The "Persistent Storage" for AI agents. Since LLMs have a "context window" limit, they eventually forget past decisions. MEMORY.md stores critical knowledge that shouldn't be lost.

Typical Content: Records of past bugs and their fixes, why certain libraries were rejected, and specific edge cases discovered during development.

Audience: Specifically designed to keep AI coding agents "up to speed" across different sessions.
